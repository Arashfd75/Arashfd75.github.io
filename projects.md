### Iran Protests Analysis : 
On September 13, 22-year-old Jina “Mahsa” Amini was arrested by Iran's morality police for “improperly” wearing her hijab, and according to her family and local media, severely beaten. She died three days later while still in police custody. In this project, I analysed twitter activity around this matter. 
I used Twitter API V2. The main metrics of this study are counts of MahsaAmini and Strikes hashtags in Farsi language. People have been using #MahsaAmini from the first day of the protests which makes this hashtag an ideal metric. Then, some important incident have been considered and their impacts on the trend of #MahsaAmini were analysed. In addition, other information like US Dollar rate is shown on the same figure. The result are illustrated using Power BI.
