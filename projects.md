### Iran Protests Analysis : 
On September 13, 22-year-old Jina “Mahsa” Amini was arrested by Iran's morality police for “improperly” wearing her hijab, and according to her family and local media, severely beaten. She died three days later while still in police custody. In this project, I analysed twitter activity around this matter.

Some of important notes:

1. I used Twitter API V2. 
2. The main metrics of this study are counts of MahsaAmini and Strikes hashtags in Farsi language. People have been using #MahsaAmini from the first day of the protests which makes this hashtag an ideal metric. 
3. Important incident have been noted on the plot and their impact on the trend of #MahsaAmini is shown.
4. US Dollar rate is shown on the same figure. 
5. The result are illustrated using Power BI.
6. The queries are stored in pandas dataframe and are set to always get information from the first date of the protests until now.
